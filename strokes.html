        <h1 class="headingmain"> Different types of Strokes</h1>




        <p class="stroketitle"> There are 4 competitive strokes in swimming. They are Freestyle, Backstroke, Breathstroke, and Butterfly. Here are some facts of how each stroke works.  </p>

        <h2 class="headingmain"> Freestyle</h2> 
        <img src="images\SF.jpg" alt="USA Swim" height="200" width="200" style="float:left;margin-left:30px; border-radius: 25px;" /> <p class="fontmenu1" style="margin-right:30px">
                                                                                                                                          Freestyle is the most common stroke of all four strokes. It is used for multiple events in a competition and is the fastest stroke. Freestyle is the first stroke a swimmer will likely learn when going to classes. When swimming freestyle, the person will stroke their arms alternately over the surface of the water and will do flutter kick on its feet all the way to the end of the pool. Once they get close to the swimming pool wall they will do a flip turn.

        <h2 class="headingmain"> Backstroke</h2>
        <img src="images\SB.jpg" alt="USA Swim" height="200" width="200" style="float:left;margin-left:30px; border-radius: 25px;" /> <p class="fontmenu1"> Backstroke is faster than breaststroke but slower than butterfly. It can give good workout to back. If people know freestyle, then they should know backstroke. It is basically freestyle but flip over on the back. When swimmer is swimming backstroke and close to wall, he/she would take one freestyle stroke and flip turn.</p>

        <h2 class="headingmain"> Breathstroke</h2>
        <img src="images\SBR.jpg" alt="USA Swim" height="200" width="200" style="float:left;margin-left:30px; border-radius: 25px;" /> <p class="fontmenu1"> Breaststroke is the slowest and popular stroke in all of the strokes. Many amateurs can only swim breaststroke because it is easiest. When swimming breaststroke, both arms do half circular movements under the water at the same time and legs do whip kick which gives power to whole stroke. In addition to that, when person touch the wall, he/she must touch it with both hands at the same time. </p>

        <h2 class="headingmain"> Butterfly</h2>
        <img src="images\SBF!.jpg" alt="USA Swim" height="200" width="200" style="float:left;margin-left:30px; border-radius: 25px;" /> <p class="fontmenu1"> Butterfly is a unique and second fastest stroke. It is hard to learn and very exhausting however when he/she masters it, then it becomes fun. When swimming butterfly, both arms fly out of the water and join together back at the water. At the same time, he/she does dolphin kick.</p>
